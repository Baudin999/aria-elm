# CK Elm starter

This is my attempt at a simpel Elm started kit with some default examples in there. I like my applicaitons
to look and feel a certain way. I also like to build applications which can handle themselves at virtually
every size. The last goal is of course relative. I understand that this will not work "at facebook" levels.

I've started this application with the standard `elm-starter-kit` (can be found [here](https://github.com/elm-community/elm-webpack-starter)) as provided by the elm-community. I've made changes to almost everything but I've left the `webpack.config.js` and the awesome `package.json` alone.

Information about this project can be found in my accompanying gitbook called [learning-elm](https://baudin999.gitbooks.io/learning-elm/content/). This GitBook is written as a documentation of the application but also as a guide detailing "things I wish I'd know before I started working with Elm".

To run the application locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/Baudin999/aria-elm.git
npm reinstall
npm start
```

This should bring up the application at `http://localhost:8080`
